0.047     2012-09-20 14:04:06 America/Los_Angeles

     Updated to be compatible with Pinto-Server 0.050.  If you
     upgrade Pinto::Remote, you'll need to upgrade the server too.

0.046     2012-08-13 17:24:54 America/Los_Angeles

     Major Changes:

     * App::Pinto::Remote and pinto-remote(1) no longer exist.  They
     have been replaced by the unified App::Pinto library and pinto(1)
     command which can perform (almost) any operation locally or
     remotely.

     Bug Fixes:

     * Outgoing requests now have a sensible name for the user agent.

     Required Upgrades:

     * You now need to have Pinto::Server-0.046 or newer installed on
     the server side.

0.039     2012-04-16 18:05:24 America/Los_Angeles

     New Features:

     The "import" command will now import a particular distribution
     if you specify it using the right notation.  See POD for details
     (Steven Leung).

     Required Upgrades:

     You now need to have Pinto-0.038 or newer installed on the server
     side.

0.038     2012-04-10 21:02:56 America/Los_Angeles

    Bug Fixes:

    Fixed bug in the "verify" command that caused a "method not found"
    error.

    Corrected the package names that we depend on.  These got moved
    around in the Pinto-Common distribution and I failed to update the
    correct names here.  Thanks CPAN Testers for helping me see this!

    Also corrected some erroneous documentation in several of the
    commands that were brought over from App::Pinto::Admin in the last
    release.

0.037     2012-04-09 14:08:28 America/Los_Angeles

    New Features:

    pinto-remote (and Pinto::Remote) can now do almost all the actions
    that pinto-admin (and Pinto::Admin) are capable of.  The only
    exceptions are "create" (which doesn't make sense to do remotely)
    and "purge" (which is too dangerous to do remotely).

    pinto-remote now supports --username and --password options, for
    passing authentication credentials to pinto-server. To properly
    authenticate with the server, you'll need version 0.036 of
    Pinto::Server or newer. (Karen Etheridge)

    The value for the --author option now defaults to the 'user'
    specified in your ~/.pause file.  If that file does not exist,
    then it still defaults to your current login name.

    pinto-remote now supports --verbose and --quiet options, so you
    can see more (or less) diagnostic messages from the server.  And
    you can use the --nocolor option to disable colorization of
    messages.  Diagnostic messages will now go to STDERR, so you can
    cleanly redirect the rest of the output into a file.

0.034     2012-03-17 08:51:16 America/Los_Angeles

    Bug Fixes:

    pinto-remote had a broken shebang.

0.033     2012-03-17 01:15:51 America/Los_Angeles

    pinto-remote add now supports --norecurse, just like pinto-admin
    (Karen Etheridge).  To use this, you'll need version 0.033 or
    better of both Pinto and Pinto::Server.

0.030     2012-01-26 22:27:48 America/Los_Angeles

    The --repos option on pinto-remote has been officially renamed to
    --root.  This was done to be symmetrical with the Pinto API.  The
    old --repos option will *not* be supported for backward
    compatibility.

0.028     2011-12-12 00:18:43 America/Los_Angeles

    Added the 'statistics', 'pin' and 'unpin' commands.  These are
    identical to the ones in pinto-admin.  You need to run
    Pinto::Server 0.028 or newer to use these commands.

    The 'list' command now supports the -p and -d options to limit the
    listing to packages or distributions that match a PATTERN.

0.026     2011-12-07 15:24:54 America/Los_Angeles

    No new functionality.  Just updating the code to match the latest
    Pinto API.  Pinto and Pinto::Remote are both evolving rapidly.  I
    make no promises about compatibility.

0.021     2011-09-03 23:41:55 America/Los_Angeles

    Added the 'ping' command, which does a Nop on the remote
    repository.  Use this to check if your remote repository is alive.

0.020     2011-09-01 15:30:23 America/Los_Angeles

    * Bug Fixes:

    The "list" command had become broken because i forgot to import
    List::MoreUtils.  I'm surprised it compiled at all.

0.019     2011-08-30 01:16:12 America/Los_Angeles

    * Interface changes:

    The --host option is now called --server or just -s.

    If you forget to put http:// in front of your server name,
    pinto-remote will kindly do it for you.

    * Other Changes:

    Now requires Pinto-Common 0.019, which has the Pinto::Constants
    library.

0.018     2011-08-24 04:05:49 America/Los_Angeles

    No interface changes.

    Just cleaned up some extra newlines in the output.

0.017     2011-08-24 00:19:31 America/Los_Angeles

    pinto-remote[1] is now zero-conf.  However, you must always
    specify the --host on the command line.

    Added support the different types of "list" actions.

    Only compatible with pinto-server 0.017 or higher.

0.001     2011-08-17 17:15:41 America/Los_Angeles

    Initial release.
