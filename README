NAME
    Pinto::Remote - Interact with a remote Pinto repository

VERSION
    version 0.047

SYNOPSIS
    See pinto to create and manage a Pinto repository.

    See pintod to allow remote access to your Pinto repository.

    See Pinto::Manual for more information about the Pinto tools.

DESCRIPTION
    Pinto::Remote is the cousin of Pinto. It provides the same API, but
    instead of running Actions against a local repository, it just sends the
    Action parameters to a pintod server that invokes Pinto on the remote
    host.

    If you are using the pinto application, it will automatically load
    either Pinto or Pinto::Remote depending on whether your repository root
    looks like a local directory path or a remote URL.

METHODS
  run( $action_name => %action_args )
    Loads the Action subclass for the given $action_name and constructs an
    object using the given $action_args. If the subclass
    "Pinto::Remote::Action::$action_name" does not exist, then it falls back
    to the Pinto::Remote::Action base class.

  add_logger( $obj )
    Convenience method for installing additional logging endpoints. The
    object must be an instance of a Log::Dispatch::Output subclass.
